# Welcome !

Thank you for registering for the Tactical Ultrasound Course for Ukraine (TUSC-UA)! This training programme will take place over two days.

On this site you will find :

* A presentation of the course: context, objectives, content and programme
* Educational resources covering each teaching session
* An image bank (under construction)
* Questionnaires to check the correct acquisition of the concepts covered (under construction)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note:** the duration of the training at the centre is limited, spread over two days. To optimize the acquisition of the course notions, each participant is expected to have read and understood the prerequisites presented on this site. The training in the centre will be concentrated on the handling of the ultrasound scanner, and there will be no lecture repeating the notions treated on this site.
{% endhint %}

This website will be updated regularly throughout the course. Do not hesitate to communicate any errors you may find to [this email address](mailto:pierre.catoire.med@gmail.com).
