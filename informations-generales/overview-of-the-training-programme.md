# Overview of the training programme

## Project background

The Russian invasion, which began on 22 February 2022, has exposed the Ukrainian military and civilian health system to a massive influx of war trauma victims. The number of casualties and the injury profile exposes the risk of saturating the health systems and exceeding the capacity designed for peacetime.

In order to increase the capacity of Ukrainian health facilities, it is necessary to increase the number of health care workers who are able to participate in the care of war wounded. To this end, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs have given the Union of Organisations for Medical Relief and Care (UOSSM), with the support of Chaîne de l'Espoir, the task of building a training programme for healthcare workers with no prior experience of tactical medicine.

This programme consists of three components:

* Medical training in War Medicine Techniques (_Apprentissage des Techniques de Médecine de Guerre_, ATMG), for doctors
* War Rescue Techniques (_Apprentissage des Techniques de Sauvetage de Guerre_, ATSG), for first aiders and volunteers
* Tactical Ultrasound Course for Ukraine (TUSC), a specific programme dedicated to the learning of tactical ultrasound in limited time, for doctors and paramedics

Each of the programme's components was built through collaboration between Ukrainian, French and international experts, to meet the specific needs of the Ukrainian situation, taking advantage of the prior expertise of Ukrainian civilian and military health care providers.

The programme benefits from the most recent innovations in technical (international recommendations) and pedagogical (integrated teaching, simulations) terms.
