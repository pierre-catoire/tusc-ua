# Learning objectives

## General objectives

Ultrasound is a fast, efficient, mobile, accessible imaging tool with no major side effects. It allows the identification of numerous traumatic lesions and their consequences, and assists in routine procedures (vascular access, loco-regional anaesthesia, pericardial drainage, etc.). Its value in traumatology has been widely demonstrated in the scientific literature.

The specific context in Ukraine leads to a major increase in the number of wounded, a change in the profile of lesions, and difficulties in accessing common radiological resources (standard radiography, scanner). Ultrasound appears to be the tool best suited to this context, as it can be used as close to the victim as possible from the first minutes of care.

Ultrasound can be learned by any health care provider, subject to appropriate and rigorous training. In the particular situation of the Ukrainian health system, giving access to the use of ultrasound to a large number of health workers is essential to improve the triage and management of victims.

**Aim of the programme:** To provide access to ultrasound practice for caregivers with no previous experience, through a short training course focused on ultrasound techniques in a tactical context.

It is therefore necessary to find the best compromise between expertise taught, practical interest, duration of teaching and volume of trained caregivers. In this sense, Ukrainian and international expert trainers have built the TUSC-UA programme to best meet the specific situation in Ukraine.&#x20;

In addition to the identification of the main traumatic lesions, it was also chosen to allow the learner to understand the functioning of the ultrasound scanner in order to adapt its use to the various situations he/she may encounter, and not only to teach him/her the standard ultrasound evaluation protocols. The aim is to consider the ultrasound scanner as a versatile tool that can help in a wide range of clinical situations.

## The T-FAST protocol

Emergency ultrasound assessment of a patient admitted with trauma was based on the FAST (Focused Abdominal Sonogram for Trauma) protocol, which identified intraperitoneal effusion. This protocol was later expanded to include the search for pericardial or pleural effusion in the Extended FAST (E-FAST) protocol.

In the specific tactical context, ultrasound can advantageously replace certain imaging means, in particular conventional radiography, when it is not accessible. In particular, the identification of a long bone fracture or a subcutaneous foreign body can be achieved with ultrasound. Similarly, the identification of an intrauterine pregnancy by ultrasound allows this to be taken into account in management from the first few minutes. The American College of Emergency Medicine (ACEP) has evaluated the [contribution of ultrasound in the context of tactical and mass casualty situations](https://www.acep.org/globalassets/uploads/uploaded-files/acep/membership/sections-of-membership/ultra/subcommittees/tactical-us-acep-final.doc). This document served as a basis for the experts to construct a tactical ultrasound protocol, integrated with the clinical assessment on admission of the trauma patient.

Other approaches have been described by [several authors](https://www.augusta.edu/mcg/ultrasound-education/tacticalpocus.php) to propose an ultrasound protocol in a tactical context. We wanted to adapt the T-FAST protocol to the specific Ukrainian context, and to arbitrate for each component of the examination between its clinical interest, its learning curve, and its time of execution.

## Specific skills

### Fundamentals of ultrasound

* Justify the use of ultrasound in a tactical context
* Describe the general operation of the ultrasound scanner: transmission, reception, analysis of ultrasound
* Interpret the image produced: echogenecity, movement, artefacts
* Explain the operation of ultrasound modes B and TM (Doppler mode is not covered in the training)
* Obtain the appropriate slice for the desired exploration by performing the appropriate translation, scanning and rotation movements
* Set up the ultrasound machine to obtain the best image quality: depth, width, gain, Tissue Gain Control, focal length
