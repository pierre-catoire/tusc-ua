# How an ultrasound scanner works

In this section, we will present the essential points for understanding the way the ultrasound machine works. In particular, we will explain:

* How ultrasound is emitted by the probe
* How it is propagated through the tissue
* How reflected ultrasound, or echoes, are formed
* Which probe to choose for which indication
* How the image is obtained
* Which ultrasound mode to choose
* How artefacts are formed and how to interpret them
* What are the adverse effects of ultrasound
